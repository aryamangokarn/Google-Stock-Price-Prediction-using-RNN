# RNN-based-Google-Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
A predictive model based on **Long Short-Term Memory** implementation of a **Recurrent Neural Network**.
</br>
## Project Description 
A Stock Market Price Predicion model using a Long Short-Term Memory with 4 hidden layers. Trained on the past 60 days data of opening stock value of Google as the learning parameters.The Data set used in this project is stock data for 5 years starting from January 2012 till December 2016 which can be downloaded from [Google_Stock_Price_Train](Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv)  and [Google_Stock_Price_Test](Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv). 
</br>
## Accuracy 
Achieved an overall loss of around (~0.12%) which is 0.0012 validation loss over 120 days past data training running for 200 epochs, calculated as Root mean squared error calculation.
